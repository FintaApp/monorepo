Coda is a great tool that can be used to manage your finances. However, manually entering transactions and investments can be tedious. First, you have to check every account at every bank for new transactions. Any accidentally slip-ups can completely turn your budget out of whack . You could try to export your data into csv, but not every bank exports data in the same way.

Finta offers a more efficient and mistake-free alternative.‚Äç
